You seem like the type to love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after this song
So give me the night to show you, hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone

You can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time
I'm not tryna rewind, 'wind, 'wind, 'wind, 'wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
'Cause shorty is a eenie-meenie-miney-mo lover
Shorty is a eenie-meenie-miney-mo lover
Shorty is a eenie-meenie-miney-mo lover
Shorty is a eenie-meenie-miney-mo lover, oh
